# Fun With PowerShell - Opening Websites with Start-Process

## Introduction

As part of my [ArcaneBooks Project](https://arcanecode.com/2023/03/13/the-arcanebooks-project-an-introduction/) I described how to use the [OpenLibrary Simple API](https://arcanecode.com/2023/03/20/arcanebooks-isbn-overview-powershell-and-the-simple-openlibrary-isbn-api/) to get book data.

In that post I also showed a way to bring up the webpage for an ISBN. I had a thought, why not build a function to add to the module to do that? This way a user would have an easy way to compare the output of the web API call to what the site holds.

In this post I'll describe how to use the `Start-Process` cmdlet to open a target webpage.

## Show-ISBNBookData

I created a new _advanced function_ and named it `Show-ISBNBookData`. Here is the opening of the function.

``` powershell
function Show-ISBNBookData
{
  [CmdletBinding(HelpURI="https://github.com/arcanecode/ArcaneBooks/blob/1ebe781951f1a7fdf19bb6731487a74fa12ad08b/ArcaneBooks/Help/Get-ISBNBookData.md")]
  [alias("sisbn")]
  param (
         [Parameter( Mandatory = $true,
                     ValueFromPipeline = $true,
                     HelpMessage = 'Please enter the ISBN.'
                     )]
         [string] $ISBN
        )
```

If you want to learn more about advanced functions, see my post [Fun With PowerShell - Advanced Functions](https://arcanecode.com/2021/09/06/fun-with-powershell-advanced-functions/). Briefly, the `CmdletBinding` attribute will turn this into an advanced function. Advanced functions allow you to input one or more parameters via the pipeline.

It has one parameter, the ISBN number you want to find. This can be passed in normally, or via the pipeline.

## The Process Loop

In order to process multiple items from the pipeline you must enclose the heart of the function inside a `process { }` block. The `process` block is called once for each item passed in via the pipeline.

I then use the `Replace` method of the string object to remove any dashes or spaces from the ISBN that was passed in. This is then combined with the base OpenLibrary URL to create a new string, `$url`.

``` powershell
  process
  {
    foreach($number in $ISBN)
    {
      Write-Verbose "Beginning Show-ISBNBookData for $ISBN at $(Get-Date).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss tt')"

      $isbnFormatted = $ISBN.Replace('-', '').Replace(' ', '')
      $baseURL = "https://openlibrary.org/isbn/"

      $url = "$($baseURL)$($isbnFormatted)"

      Write-Verbose 'Opening the Book on OpenLibrary'

      Start-Process $url

      Write-Verbose "Finished Getting Data for $($ISBN)"
    }
```

The magic comes in the `Start-Process` cmdlet. This cmdlet analyzes the string that was passed in. It then looks for the default application for it, and attempts to open the associated application for the passed in string.

As an example, if you were to pass in the name of a Microsoft Word document, `Start-Process` would open Microsoft Word with the document name you passed in.

In this case, passing in a URL will attempt to open up your default web browser to the page you passed in.

If you called `Show-ISBNBookData` using the pipeline, the function will attempt to open up a new tab in your browser for each URL passed in via the pipeline.

Note I also used several `Write-Verbose` commands, you can learn more about it at [Fun With PowerShell - Write-Verbose](https://arcanecode.com/2021/09/27/fun-with-powershell-write-verbose/).

# An Example

Calling the function is very simple.

``` powershell
$ISBN = '0-87259-481-5'
Show-ISBNBookData -ISBN $ISBN -Verbose
```

This should open up the following webpage in your default browser.

[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL894295M/Your_HF_digital_companion](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL894295M/Your_HF_digital_companion)

## Conclusion

As you can see, `Start-Process` is extremely easy to use. Just pass in a URL or the name of a file, and PowerShell will attempt to open the item using the default application assigned in the operating system. In the ArcaneBooks project I'm using it to open a website, but you can use it for a variety of purposes.
