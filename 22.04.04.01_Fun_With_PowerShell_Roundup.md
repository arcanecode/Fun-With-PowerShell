# The Fun With PowerShell Roundup

## Introduction

Since September 2020 I've been posting extensively about PowerShell in a series I've titled **Fun With PowerShell**. In my next post I will begin a series on a new topic, but before I do I wanted to leave with a **Fun With PowerShell** Roundup" post.

Below you will find a listing of all posts in my **Fun With PowerShell** series. Note there are other posts I've done in this time frame, but since they did not focus on PowerShell I've omitted them from this listing.

## Conclusion

This is the wrap up post for my **Fun With PowerShell** series. Use it as an index to quickly refer back to posts of interest to you. These will make a good quick reference to the many aspects of PowerShell programming.

In my next blog post I'll begin a new "Fun With..." series, so stay tuned for more fun.

All of the posts in my **Fun With PowerShell** series were inspired by my Pluralsight course [PowerShell 7 Quick Start for Developers on Linux, macOS and Windows](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/jWzbre), one of many PowerShell courses I have on Pluralsight. All of my courses are linked on my [About Me](https://arcanecode.com/info/) page.

If you don't have a Pluralsight subscription, just go to [my list of courses on Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/kjz6jn) . At the top is a Try For Free button you can use to get a free 10 day subscription to Pluralsight, with which you can watch my courses, or any other course on the site.
